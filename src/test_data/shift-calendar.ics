 (NakedHearts)
CONTACT:NakedHearts:Pdx
DESCRIPTION:Our instagram is nakedHeartspdx so you can see how we ride. 
 \n\nWeekly themed rides. \nDifferent ride leaders each week\, but you can 
 expect the ride to be social paced (8ish mph)\, no-drop\, safe and 
 welcoming\, store stop with safe clean bathroom access and the ride is 
 always a loop. We practice consent and non-violence specially with car 
 interactions\, what one ride does affects how all rides get treated.  
 \n\nThe Mellow Mondays are a space for (new) ride leaders to try out ideas
  in a very supported environment. You’ll often see Mondays rides appearing
  again during the warmer riding season. \n\nWe follow the shift code of 
 conduct and expect everyone to be respectful of themselves and others 
 around them.  This is so we can actually relax and have fun and connect 
 with each other in a softer space. \n\nThis isn’t a sober ride but we ask 
 for moderation to keep the atmosphere relaxed.\n\nWe recommend Abraham 
 Fixes bikes in N Williams and NomadCycles (e-bike specialist) for 
 repairs/sales and parts. \nOur friends over at RideSafePDX host regular 
 ride and we’ recommend those as a pleasant warm group to ride with.\nRide 
 at 7:30\nEnds at Ride is always a 
 loop\nhttps://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-22726

SUMMARY:(We leave at 7:30pm) Mellow Mondays 2026. 5th year. Weekly themed 
 rides.No drop. Beginner friendly. Slow social pace. NakedHearts: PDX (see 
 insta).
CONTACT:NakedHearts:PDX
DESCRIPTION:Cody leads\, ‘Girl Power\; Music not from Men’\nWelcome to 
 Mellow Mondays 2026.\n\nAre you interested in leading a ride? This is a 
 supportive and organized way to lead for the first time. \n\nEvery week 
 there’s different themes but there are constants….\nSlow pace\, about 8 
 mph\,\nDistance varies but approx 10 miles\,\nFamily friendly\,\nWe 
 practice consent and non-violence on all our rides\, \nStore stop for safe
  clean bathroom access but generally we try and make these stops short\, 
 \nSkater friendly (but please check with ride leader about crunchy or 
 potential issues for skates)\,\nALL Wheels friendly (scooter\, skates\, 
 skateboard\, e bikes etc)\, \nRide is always a loop\,\nCorking and traffic
  intersections are calm.\nBe mindful of smoking around others and do not 
 smoke around children. \n\nFAQ\,\nCan I bring a speaker? Yes but please 
 speak to the ride leader and play the music they’ve carefully selected or 
 what their preference is. \n\nCan I lead a ride? Yes\, please attend a few
  first and get a feel for how the rides are. \n\nI’ve heard NakedHearts 
 supports other rides? Yes\, we can help with planning\, encouragement\, 
 promotion\, sound support and what not. \n\nWhat do you mean you practice 
 consent? We ask everyone (even friends\, relatives\, husbands and wives 
 with each other) to ask for permission before touching anyone else or 
 their belongings and when asking to seek listen and empower ‘No’.\n\nWhat 
 do you mean you practice Non-violence? We specifically expect everyone to 
 be calm\, kind and respectful with all car interactions. One riders 
 aggression to a car driver can put everyone else at risk. We live in a 
 small city and are bound to encounter the same drivers again. \n\nAre all 
 your rides a protest? Yes\, being together with respect and acceptance and
  finding comfort and joy around others and strangers is an act of protest 
 against the divisive paradigm we are in.\nActually we leave at 7:30 
 now…it’s too cold to hang around\nhttps://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-

SUMMARY:Thursday Night Ride
CONTACT:Thursday Night Ride
DESCRIPTION:TNR #563: Terry\nThursday Night Ride is Portland’s longest-
 running weekly social ride\, riding every Thursday night since 
 2015!\n\nRoutes and ride leaders change weekly\, but expect an energetic 
 party-paced “rolling dive bar” of a ride for newcomers and regulars alike.
  Most rides will feature park and store stops\, but come prepared to have 
 fun and celebrate cycling together—other wheeled guests should respect the
  pace and space of cyclists.\n\nNew leadership\, same positive vibes. 
 While you might expect some wheelies and other chaos\, riders are expected
  to follow Shift’s Code of Conduct\, and if you’re banned from any Shift 
 rides\, TNR isn’t for you. No complaints\, just accountability—if your 
 behavior makes others feel uncomfortable or unsafe\, please leave the ride
  before the ride leaves you. Riders should practice consent\, 
 accountability\, respect\, and de-escalation at all times. Stay behind the
  ride leader and don’t forget to thank a corker!\n\n📍 Salmon Street 
 Springs\, every Thursday\, rain or shine.\n🕖 Meet at 7:00\, announcements
  by 7:30\, leave after “Beer Minutes.”\n🕢 If you’re not at the fountain 
 by 7:30\, you may want to meet us at the next stop.\n🧭 Live Location:

DESCRIPTION:Ride is going to be slow paced\, store stop will be about 20 
 Mins\, ride is a loop.\nWe’ve wireless mics so we can ride and sing at the
  same time. \n\nTaking these opportunities to ride in the sun. Expecting a
  quick cold winter is going to descend soon so time too ride…\n\nKaraoke 
 bike ride is Karaoke as you’d expect \, but without the bar scene or big 
 screen….or the anxiety. \n\nIt’s different and a very specific vibe to 
 karaoke while actually riding\, that nearly everyone can’t see your face 
 is liberating\, having your body engaged in rising a bike is grounding and
  just the sense of freedom is so unique. \n\nIt’s like regular karaoke but
  with your friends.\n\nThere is no longer a ban on Nickleback and so all 
 songs are allowed but we ask to avoid picking longer songs….\nYou also 
 only need to sing as much as you’d like\, maybe you just want to blast out
  the chorus and that’s ok…it’s your ride and your karaoke time and you 
 choose how you want to do it.\nRide leaves at

SUMMARY:(NakedHearts:PDX) Tibetan Chants ride (Dechen Shak Dagsay and her 
 music with The Queen of Rock n Roll\, Tina Turner\, heavily feature on the
  playlist)
CONTACT:NakedHearts:PDX (Moorland leads)
DESCRIPTION:In the spirit of building bridges with the Splinter  rides 
 that’s happening. at the same time this ride might merge and become 
 something different. We might splinter off from our own ride and join the 
 splinter of the splinter group and become another  splinter group and 
 ride….either way we will be playing Tibetan chants and probably the other 
 groups music too\nWhat can you expect? \nRelaxing ethereal music that 
 feels empowering and calming ……Music that softens the stress and angst of 
 life and lights warmth in the attitudes of love and self care and the care
  of others. Also\, we’re going to rock out to some Tina Turner and get our
  feet moving. \n\nI found this music when a freind of mine recommended 
 Dechen-Shak-Dagsay as music to listen too while in an Airport. It 
 transformed the experience for me. Then I discovered the work she’s been 
 doing with Tina Turner. It blew my mind…..\nIf you’ve been on any rides 
 I’ve lead\, chances are you’ve heard this music at some time. \n\nThis 
 will be a serene adventure….\nhttps://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-23151

CONTACT:Revolutionary Bicycle Club (RBC)
DESCRIPTION:The world is on fire and Iran is no exception. In the past few
  weeks\, Iranian people have risen up once again in the face of decades of
  repression at the hands of their government and in the face of Western 
 sanctions. Ultimately\, Iranians want what we all want: Liberation. The 
 Peoples of Iran - the Kurds\, Baluchis\, Azaris\, Arabs\, Persians\, etc -
  demand the right of self-determination and the ability to live peacefully
  amongst each other. And\, their struggle is our struggle.\n\nMake no 
 mistake that the West has a vested interest in seeing the fall of the 
 Islamic Republic of Iran. But this is not for the benefit of the Iranian 
 people but rather a desire for the oil under Iranian land - the third 
 largest reserves in the world. The USA\, Great Britain and Israel only 
 seek to expand empire\, masquerading as crusaders for freedom. And\, we 
 know that the oligarchs and architects of empire wish nothing more than to
  keep people addicted to fossil fuels. As Peoples in the struggle for 
 Collective Liberation\, we can and must break this reliance.\n\nWe invite 
 you to join us on a ride for solidarity with the people of Iran in their 
 fight for liberation. We'll play Iranian music - new and old\, traditional
  and pop - and convey the spirit and voice of the Iranian people on 
 Portland's streets.\n\nBring your revolutionary spirit and critical 
 thoughts about the Iranian struggle and how we can work toward Collective 
 Liberation.\nMeet at noon\, Ride at 12:30 
 pm\nhttps://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-23201

CONTACT:NakedHearts:Pdx
DESCRIPTION:Our instagram is nakedHeartspdx so you can see how we ride. 
 \n\nWeekly themed rides. \nDifferent ride leaders each week\, but you can 
 expect the ride to be social paced (8ish mph)\, no-drop\, safe and 
 welcoming\, store stop with safe clean bathroom access and the ride is 
 always a loop. We practice consent and non-violence specially with car 
 interactions\, what one ride does affects how all rides get treated.  
 \n\nThe Mellow Mondays are a space for (new) ride leaders to try out ideas
  in a very supported environment. You’ll often see Mondays rides appearing
  again during the warmer riding season. \n\nWe follow the shift code of 
 conduct and expect everyone to be respectful of themselves and others 
 around them.  This is so we can actually relax and have fun and connect 
 with each other in a softer space. \n\nThis isn’t a sober ride but we ask 
 for moderation to keep the atmosphere relaxed.\n\nWe recommend Abraham 
 Fixes bikes in N Williams and NomadCycles (e-bike specialist) for 
 repairs/sales and parts. \nOur friends over at RideSafePDX host regular 
 ride and we’ recommend those as a pleasant warm group to ride with.\nRide

SUMMARY:(We leave at 7:30pm) Mellow Mondays 2026. 5th year. Weekly themed 
 rides.No drop. Beginner friendly. Slow social pace. NakedHearts: PDX (see 
 insta).
CONTACT:NakedHearts:PDX
DESCRIPTION:Caz leads\, ‘Nothing Rhymes with Orange Ride’ A whimsical 
 journey where you might even learm a thing or two. Celebrity guest. Caz 
 flair. Chill. Inclusive.\nWelcome to Mellow Mondays 2026.\n\nAre you 
 interested in leading a ride? This is a supportive and organized way to 
 lead for the first time. \n\nEvery week there’s different themes but there
  are constants….\nSlow pace\, about 8 mph\,\nDistance varies but approx 10
  miles\,\nFamily friendly\,\nWe practice consent and non-violence on all 
 our rides\, \nStore stop for safe clean bathroom access but generally we 
 try and make these stops short\, \nSkater friendly (but please check with 
 ride leader about crunchy or potential issues for skates)\,\nALL Wheels 
 friendly (scooter\, skates\, skateboard\, e bikes etc)\, \nRide is always 
 a loop\,\nCorking and traffic intersections are calm.\nBe mindful of 
 smoking around others and do not smoke around children. \n\nFAQ\,\nCan I 
 bring a speaker? Yes but please speak to the ride leader and play the 
 music they’ve carefully selected or what their preference is. \n\nCan I 
 lead a ride? Yes\, please attend a few first and get a feel for how the 
 rides are. \n\nI’ve heard NakedHearts supports other rides? Yes\, we can 
 help with planning\, encouragement\, promotion\, sound support and what 
 not. \n\nWhat do you mean you practice consent? We ask everyone (even 
 friends\, relatives\, husbands and wives with each other) to ask for 
 permission before touching anyone else or their belongings and when asking
  to seek listen and empower ‘No’.\n\nWhat do you mean you practice Non-
 violence? We specifically expect everyone to be calm\, kind and respectful
  with all car interactions. One riders aggression to a car driver can put 
 everyone else at risk. We live in a small city and are bound to encounter 
 the same drivers again. \n\nAre all your rides a protest? Yes\, being 
 together with respect and acceptance and finding comfort and joy around 
 others and strangers is an act of protest against the divisive paradigm we
  are in.\nActually we leave at 7:30 now…it’s too cold to hang 
 around\nhttps://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-23016

DESCRIPTION:TNR #564: John Russell’s birthday\nThursday Night Ride is 
 Portland’s longest-running weekly social ride\, riding every Thursday 
 night since 2015!\n\nRoutes and ride leaders change weekly\, but expect an
  energetic party-paced “rolling dive bar” of a ride for newcomers and 
 regulars alike. Most rides will feature park and store stops\, but come 
 prepared to have fun and celebrate cycling together—other wheeled guests 
 should respect the pace and space of cyclists.\n\nNew leadership\, same 
 positive vibes. While you might expect some wheelies and other chaos\, 
 riders are expected to follow Shift’s Code of Conduct\, and if you’re 
 banned from any Shift rides\, TNR isn’t for you. No complaints\, just 
 accountability—if your behavior makes others feel uncomfortable or 
 unsafe\, please leave the ride before the ride leaves you. Riders should 
 practice consent\, accountability\, respect\, and de-escalation at all 
 times. Stay behind the ride leader and don’t forget to thank a 
 corker!\n\n📍 Salmon Street Springs\, every Thursday\, rain or shine.\n🕖 
 Meet at 7:00\, announcements by 7:30\, leave after “Beer Minutes.”\n🕢 If

SUMMARY:The Terrible Tualatin Tumbler
CONTACT:Cycle Cats PDX
DESCRIPTION:Cycle Cats looking to start the year off with a fun and 
 exploratory ride.  We will be heading south down through Tigard and an 
 exciting way into Tualatin.  There will be funny business.  Mostly cut 
 thrus around the neighborhoods and a couple muddy/dirty/bark chip infested
  trails.  We are a faster and more adventurous group ride with a no drop 
 mentality.  We are going to be taking it easy and focus more on a social 
 pace.  We will let you know the details of the descents and things to look
  out for and this would be a great chance to work on some technical bike 
 skills.  We will have the opportunity for a store stop\, all depends on 
 the vibes of the tribe\, and a cool area to explore.  We will be leaving 
 the Beaverton Transit Center around 11 a.m. and returning around 4 p.m.  
 Give us time to explore\, eat\, chat\, and ride!  There may be a ride to 
 the ride so keep your eyes on the calendar.  The ride will be about 31 
 miles with 1\,200 feet of elevation.  It will be cold but should be dry.  
 Follow us on IG @cyclecatspdx  Find your bike!!\nMeet up at 10:30ish and

CONTACT:NakedHearts:Pdx
DESCRIPTION:Our instagram is nakedHeartspdx so you can see how we ride. 
 \n\nWeekly themed rides. \nDifferent ride leaders each week\, but you can 
 expect the ride to be social paced (8ish mph)\, no-drop\, safe and 
 welcoming\, store stop with safe clean bathroom access and the ride is 
 always a loop. We practice consent and non-violence specially with car 
 interactions\, what one ride does affects how all rides get treated.  
 \n\nThe Mellow Mondays are a space for (new) ride leaders to try out ideas
  in a very supported environment. You’ll often see Mondays rides appearing
  again during the warmer riding season. \n\nWe follow the shift code of 
 conduct and expect everyone to be respectful of themselves and others 
 around them.  This is so we can actually relax and have fun and connect 
 with each other in a softer space. \n\nThis isn’t a sober ride but we ask 
 for moderation to keep the atmosphere relaxed.\n\nWe recommend Abraham 
 Fixes bikes in N Williams and NomadCycles (e-bike specialist) for 
 repairs/sales and parts. \nOur friends over at RideSafePDX host regular 
 ride and we’ recommend those as a pleasant warm group to ride with.\nRide

DESCRIPTION:Sable leads ‘70’s Disco ride’ “In preparation for a summer 
 ride when we will properly resurrect the spirit of disco with dress and 
 dance\, we will be listening to disco hits of the 70's while having some 
 70's trivia on stops."\nWelcome to Mellow Mondays 2026.\n\nAre you 
 interested in leading a ride? This is a supportive and organized way to 
 lead for the first time. \n\nEvery week there’s different themes but there
  are constants….\nSlow pace\, about 8 mph\,\nDistance varies but approx 10
  miles\,\nFamily friendly\,\nWe practice consent and non-violence on all 
 our rides\, \nStore stop for safe clean bathroom access but generally we 
 try and make these stops short\, \nSkater friendly (but please check with 
 ride leader about crunchy or potential issues for skates)\,\nALL Wheels 
 friendly (scooter\, skates\, skateboard\, e bikes etc)\, \nRide is always 
 a loop\,\nCorking and traffic intersections are calm.\nBe mindful of 
 smoking around others and do not smoke around children. \n\nFAQ\,\nCan I 
 bring a speaker? Yes but please speak to the ride leader and play the 
 music they’ve carefully selected or what their preference is. \n\nCan I 
 lead a ride? Yes\, please attend a few first and get a feel for how the 
 rides are. \n\nI’ve heard NakedHearts supports other rides? Yes\, we can 
 help with planning\, encouragement\, promotion\, sound support and what 
 not. \n\nWhat do you mean you practice consent? We ask everyone (even 
 friends\, relatives\, husbands and wives with each other) to ask for 
 permission before touching anyone else or their belongings and when asking
  to seek listen and empower ‘No’.\n\nWhat do you mean you practice Non-
 violence? We specifically expect everyone to be calm\, kind and respectful
  with all car interactions. One riders aggression to a car driver can put 
 everyone else at risk. We live in a small city and are bound to encounter 
 the same drivers again. \n\nAre all your rides a protest? Yes\, being 
 together with respect and acceptance and finding comfort and joy around 
 others and strangers is an act of protest against the divisive paradigm we
  are in.\nActually we leave at 7:30 now…it’s too cold to hang 
 around\nhttps://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-23017

 24 miles and 2k+ feet of elevation.  Prepare the P.M.A. and your

SUMMARY:Thursday Night Ride
CONTACT:Thursday Night Ride
DESCRIPTION:TNR #565: Colin’s Birthday\nThursday Night Ride is Portland’s 
 longest-running weekly social ride\, riding every Thursday night since 
 2015!\n\nRoutes and ride leaders change weekly\, but expect an energetic 
 party-paced “rolling dive bar” of a ride for newcomers and regulars alike.
  Most rides will feature park and store stops\, but come prepared to have 
 fun and celebrate cycling together—other wheeled guests should respect the
  pace and space of cyclists.\n\nNew leadership\, same positive vibes. 
 While you might expect some wheelies and other chaos\, riders are expected
  to follow Shift’s Code of Conduct\, and if you’re banned from any Shift 
 rides\, TNR isn’t for you. No complaints\, just accountability—if your 
 behavior makes others feel uncomfortable or unsafe\, please leave the ride
  before the ride leaves you. Riders should practice consent\, 
 accountability\, respect\, and de-escalation at all times. Stay behind the
  ride leader and don’t forget to thank a corker!\n\n📍 Salmon Street 
 Springs\, every Thursday\, rain or shine.\n🕖 Meet at 7:00\, announcements
  by 7:30\, leave after “Beer Minutes.”\n🕢 If you’re not at the fountain

SUMMARY:(We leave at 7:30pm) Mellow Mondays 2026. 5th year. Weekly themed 
 rides.No drop. Beginner friendly. Slow social pace. NakedHearts: PDX (see 
 insta).
CONTACT:NakedHearts:PDX
DESCRIPTION:(We are not going anywhere near ice) Change of plans\, ride is
  going to be ‘Muscians of Minnesota’\, Artists such as Prince\, Bob Dylan.
  Lizzo\, The Replacements\, Judy Garland and more…..\nWelcome to Mellow 
 Mondays 2026.\n\nAre you interested in leading a ride? This is a 
 supportive and organized way to lead for the first time. \n\nEvery week 
 there’s different themes but there are constants….\nSlow pace\, about 8 
 mph\,\nDistance varies but approx 10 miles\,\nFamily friendly\,\nWe 
 practice consent and non-violence on all our rides\, \nStore stop for safe
  clean bathroom access but generally we try and make these stops short\, 
 \nSkater friendly (but please check with ride leader about crunchy or 
 potential issues for skates)\,\nALL Wheels friendly (scooter\, skates\, 
 skateboard\, e bikes etc)\, \nRide is always a loop\,\nCorking and traffic
  intersections are calm.\nBe mindful of smoking around others and do not 
 smoke around children. \n\nFAQ\,\nCan I bring a speaker? Yes but please 
 speak to the ride leader and play the music they’ve carefully selected or 
 what their preference is. \n\nCan I lead a ride? Yes\, please attend a few
  first and get a feel for how the rides are. \n\nI’ve heard NakedHearts 
 supports other rides? Yes\, we can help with planning\, encouragement\, 
 promotion\, sound support and what not. \n\nWhat do you mean you practice 
 consent? We ask everyone (even friends\, relatives\, husbands and wives 
 with each other) to ask for permission before touching anyone else or 
 their belongings and when asking to seek listen and empower ‘No’.\n\nWhat 
 do you mean you practice Non-violence? We specifically expect everyone to 
 be calm\, kind and respectful with all car interactions. One riders 
 aggression to a car driver can put everyone else at risk. We live in a 
 small city and are bound to encounter the same drivers again. \n\nAre all 
 your rides a protest? Yes\, being together with respect and acceptance and
  finding comfort and joy around others and strangers is an act of protest 
 against the divisive paradigm we are in.\nActually we leave at 7:30 
 now…it’s too cold to hang around\nhttps://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-

 Night Ride is Portland’s longest-running weekly social ride\, riding every
  Thursday night since 2015!\n\nRoutes and ride leaders change weekly\, but
  expect an energetic party-paced “rolling dive bar” of a ride for 
 newcomers and regulars alike. Most rides will feature park and store 
 stops\, but come prepared to have fun and celebrate cycling together—other
  wheeled guests should respect the pace and space of cyclists.\n\nNew 
 leadership\, same positive vibes. While you might expect some wheelies and
  other chaos\, riders are expected to follow Shift’s Code of Conduct\, and
  if you’re banned from any Shift rides\, TNR isn’t for you. No 
 complaints\, just accountability—if your behavior makes others feel 
 uncomfortable or unsafe\, please leave the ride before the ride leaves 
 you. Riders should practice consent\, accountability\, respect\, and de-
 escalation at all times. Stay behind the ride leader and don’t forget to 
 thank a corker!\n\n📍 Salmon Street Springs\, every Thursday\, rain or

DESCRIPTION:Prospect Steller's Jay | It's that time again for the birds to
  fly. Same time same place! Join us for a ride lead by our newest 
 prospect\, Steller's Jay.   Be prepared for a little bit of a hoof as we 
 head north to Smith & Bybee wetlands and then noodle our way through NoPo 
 to an end spot. There will be some stops for breathers along the way\, but
  be sure to bring your own snacks as there will be no dedicated store 
 stop. We'll have some tools and first-aid on deck\, but please bring spare
  tubes. Additionally\, we are collecting non-perishables if you wanted to 
 bring what you can to the start\, and we'll collect them before you dip.
    Remember\, this is a safer space for us all! Look out for each other\, 
 cork if you feel called\, consent is the coolest\, and dont be a somethin'
  or other\; we dont tolerate BS. See yall then!!!\nEstablished in 2017\, 
 we ride once a month to enjoy what this city has to offer. Each month is 
 led by a different CORVIDAE member\, and therefore will be unique. We 
 occasionally have themes or additional donations to different 
 organizations. Additionally\, host pop-up rides during the summer and 
 collect dry non perishables for food donations every month.\n\n​We try to 
 focus our rides on greenways\, group etiquette\, safety measures and 
 general comradery. In addition to bike safety and accessibility\, we want 
 to promote using bicycles as an alternative to fossil fueled travel within
  Portland. \n \nThis is a no-drop ride\, but please bring your repair kit 
 with a spare tube so we can keep the ride rolling. Please bring your own 
 provisions\; we’ll be stopping near stores\, but not at them. Each member 
 has an eye out for the crowd\, will cork\, sweep and be a general pillar 
 of support. Ride pace is casual at around 10 miles with a few park stops. 
 \n \nWe aim to impress that this is a safe environment for all\; no 
 aggressive\, sexist\, racist\, or any other kind of BS will be tolerated. 
 Please review our Corvidae Code of Conduct.\n\nMeet 2nd Sunday of every 
 month\nHang at 1 PM \nWheels down at 2 PM sharp\nBring your respect for 
 each and the city. Leave no trace 🤘🏽\nMeet at 1PM. Roll out at

SUMMARY:CANCELLED: Palm Tree Ride
CONTACT:Urban Adventure League
DESCRIPTION:Pretty wet weather ahead for Sunday. Hope to reschedule either
  on the 15 or 22\, check back for updates.\nThe premise\, as it has been 
 since 2005\, is the same: An approximately 10 mile casual bicycle ride 
 (not a loop) exploring the palm trees around town\, with some other 
 exotics and evergreens thrown in\, like eucalyptus\, madronas\, yuccas\, 
 Oregon myrtles\, and more. These trees and shrubs keep the city green 
 through our grey and cool winter months\, when all the deciduous trees 
 have dropped their leaves. Seeing a bunch of them in the middle of winter 
 brightens the mood\, and reminds us that winter here may not be as bad as 
 we feel.\n\nAfter the ride ends there will be an option for interested 
 folks to get food and libations.\n\nRide will happen in good weather or a 
 bit of rain. Heavy rain or wintry conditions can postpone this event\, 
 I'll announce any changes within 24 hours of the start time\, check back 
 here for deets.\nMeet at 10:30\, we depart at 11 
 AM.\nhttps://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-22962

CONTACT:NakedHearts:PDX
DESCRIPTION:We ride to the portland Winter Lights Festival\nWelcome to 
 Mellow Mondays 2026.\n\nAre you interested in leading a ride? This is a 
 supportive and organized way to lead for the first time. \n\nEvery week 
 there’s different themes but there are constants….\nSlow pace\, about 8 
 mph\,\nDistance varies but approx 10 miles\,\nFamily friendly\,\nWe 
 practice consent and non-violence on all our rides\, \nStore stop for safe
  clean bathroom access but generally we try and make these stops short\, 
 \nSkater friendly (but please check with ride leader about crunchy or 
 potential issues for skates)\,\nALL Wheels friendly (scooter\, skates\, 
 skateboard\, e bikes etc)\, \nRide is always a loop\,\nCorking and traffic
  intersections are calm.\nBe mindful of smoking around others and do not 
 smoke around children. \n\nFAQ\,\nCan I bring a speaker? Yes but please 
 speak to the ride leader and play the music they’ve carefully selected or 
 what their preference is. \n\nCan I lead a ride? Yes\, please attend a few
  first and get a feel for how the rides are. \n\nI’ve heard NakedHearts 
 supports other rides? Yes\, we can help with planning\, encouragement\, 
 promotion\, sound support and what not. \n\nWhat do you mean you practice 
 consent? We ask everyone (even friends\, relatives\, husbands and wives 
 with each other) to ask for permission before touching anyone else or 
 their belongings and when asking to seek listen and empower ‘No’.\n\nWhat 
 do you mean you practice Non-violence? We specifically expect everyone to 
 be calm\, kind and respectful with all car interactions. One riders 
 aggression to a car driver can put everyone else at risk. We live in a 
 small city and are bound to encounter the same drivers again. \n\nAre all 
 your rides a protest? Yes\, being together with respect and acceptance and
  finding comfort and joy around others and strangers is an act of protest 
 against the divisive paradigm we are in.\nActually we leave at 7:30 
 now…it’s too cold to hang around\nhttps://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-

SUMMARY:Winter Light Festival at Bike Happy Hour - Ride to North Portland 
 Exhibits
CONTACT:Tom Howe
DESCRIPTION:The Portland Winter Light Festival runs from Feb. 6 through 14
  and features illuminated exhibits throughout Portland. This ride leaves 
 from Bike Happy Hour to visit exhibits in north Portland.\n\nThe two mile 
 route is a loop and ends back at Migration Brewing. That's a short loop 
 but it includes all the exhibits in north Portland except two. Those two 
 missing exhibits are at Hayden Island and Cathedral Park and would result 
 in a much longer ride!\n\nThis is one of seven bike routes throughout 
 Portland published on the PDXWLF website. See all seven routes at this 
 link:\n\nhttps://pdxwlf.com/bike-routes-by-zone/\n\nBike Happy Hour is 
 every Wednesday running from 3 to 6pm\, so get there early to join other 
 bike-minded folks for drinks\, food and community.\nMeet at 6:00pm\, ride 
 at 6:30pm\nhttps://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-23291

SUMMARY:Westside Wednesday Ride Trails Pop-Up
CONTACT:Cycle Cats PDX
DESCRIPTION:The weather is great so lets go ride our bikes.  We have a fun
  bike path focused route that will keep us off the main roads as much as 
 possible.  There will be some climbing but dudes\, it will be so worth the
  long and fun descents we will encounter because of the hills.  This is a 
 route we have ridden in the past.  There is some dirt trail we will also 
 be riding but nothing too crazy.  Those 28mm slicks should be just fine 
 with a little added effort.  The ride is 17 miles and almost 900 feet of 
 climbing.  Faster and more adventurous but with a no drop mentality.  
 Since it is a pop-up and path focused we will meet up at 6:30 and roll out
  at 7 so a little earlier than normal.  Cowabunga!\nMeet up at 6:30 and 
 rolling out at 7.\nEnds at Back at the 
 B.T.C.\nhttps://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-23292
LOCATION:Beaverton Transit Center\n45.49064 N\, 122.66821 W\nAcross from

SUMMARY:Thursday Night Ride
CONTACT:Thursday Night Ride
DESCRIPTION:TNR #567: PDX WLF\nThursday Night Ride is Portland’s longest-
 running weekly social ride\, riding every Thursday night since 
 2015!\n\nRoutes and ride leaders change weekly\, but expect an energetic 
 party-paced “rolling dive bar” of a ride for newcomers and regulars alike.
  Most rides will feature park and store stops\, but come prepared to have 
 fun and celebrate cycling together—other wheeled guests should respect the
  pace and space of cyclists.\n\nNew leadership\, same positive vibes. 
 While you might expect some wheelies and other chaos\, riders are expected
  to follow Shift’s Code of Conduct\, and if you’re banned from any Shift 
 rides\, TNR isn’t for you. No complaints\, just accountability—if your 
 behavior makes others feel uncomfortable or unsafe\, please leave the ride
  before the ride leaves you. Riders should practice consent\, 
 accountability\, respect\, and de-escalation at all times. Stay behind the
  ride leader and don’t forget to thank a corker!\n\n📍 Salmon Street 
 Springs\, every Thursday\, rain or shine.\n🕖 Meet at 7:00\, announcements
  by 7:30\, leave after “Beer Minutes.”\n🕢 If you’re not at the fountain 
 by 7:30\, you may want to meet us at the next stop.\n🧭 Live Location:

 insta).
CONTACT:NakedHearts:PDX
DESCRIPTION:Shawna leads for the first time A Mardi Gras ride.\nWelcome to
  Mellow Mondays 2026.\n\nAre you interested in leading a ride? This is a 
 supportive and organized way to lead for the first time. \n\nEvery week 
 there’s different themes but there are constants….\nSlow pace\, about 8 
 mph\,\nDistance varies but approx 10 miles\,\nFamily friendly\,\nWe 
 practice consent and non-violence on all our rides\, \nStore stop for safe
  clean bathroom access but generally we try and make these stops short\, 
 \nSkater friendly (but please check with ride leader about crunchy or 
 potential issues for skates)\,\nALL Wheels friendly (scooter\, skates\, 
 skateboard\, e bikes etc)\, \nRide is always a loop\,\nCorking and traffic
  intersections are calm.\nBe mindful of smoking around others and do not 
 smoke around children. \n\nFAQ\,\nCan I bring a speaker? Yes but please 
 speak to the ride leader and play the music they’ve carefully selected or 
 what their preference is. \n\nCan I lead a ride? Yes\, please attend a few
  first and get a feel for how the rides are. \n\nI’ve heard NakedHearts 
 supports other rides? Yes\, we can help with planning\, encouragement\, 
 promotion\, sound support and what not. \n\nWhat do you mean you practice 
 consent? We ask everyone (even friends\, relatives\, husbands and wives 
 with each other) to ask for permission before touching anyone else or 
 their belongings and when asking to seek listen and empower ‘No’.\n\nWhat 
 do you mean you practice Non-violence? We specifically expect everyone to 
 be calm\, kind and respectful with all car interactions. One riders 
 aggression to a car driver can put everyone else at risk. We live in a 
 small city and are bound to encounter the same drivers again. \n\nAre all 
 your rides a protest? Yes\, being together with respect and acceptance and
  finding comfort and joy around others and strangers is an act of protest 
 against the divisive paradigm we are in.\nActually we leave at 7:30 
 now…it’s too cold to hang around\nhttps://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-

SUMMARY:Zwickelmania: The Ride
CONTACT:Rooster
DESCRIPTION:Spend a day (or a few hours) riding between a few of 
 Portland's finest craft breweries with your newest and best friends!  
 \n\n*****PLEASE CHECK BACK ON FRIDAY\, FEBRUARY 20 FOR FINAL 
 DETAILS*****\n\nDetails are all subject to change as the day approaches 
 and more breweries post their particulars.  Likely stops include Gigantic 
 near Reed College\, Baerlic on SE 11th\, Living HAus (sorry\, no umlauts 
 on this keyboard) on SE Belmont\, Wayfinder on SE 2nd\, Backwoods on NW 
 11th\, Level on inner Sandy Blvd\, Rosenstadt on NE Oregon\, Lazy Days on 
 N Flint\, Widmer Brothers on N Russell\, and Commensal on N Williams.  The
  ride won't quite be a loop\, ending near Steeplejack on NE Broadway.  
 I'll refine this list as more specifics become available.  You should be 
 able to join the ride with some certainty at each of the breweries that 
 end up on the itinerary.  You will want to join up not later than the last
  brewery listed if you want to be at the after-ride meet-up as space at 
 that location is limited and I want to make sure that I have a place at 
 the bar for myself and the folks who kept me company for the day 
 :)\n\nAnticipate ride legs less than 5 miles every hour or two\, including
  at least three breweries.  Drop in or out as you like.  There may or may 
 not be food available at the various stops\, so be prepared.  I carry no 
 tools\, so unless one of the traveling mechanics decides to offer their 
 services\, you'll be on your own for any problems you might have with your
  bike.  You will need to be at the last brewery to find out about the 
 final destination for post-ride libations.\nDetails still developing\, 
 likely ride at 10:30 am with three to five brewery stops\, intending to 
 arrive at the end point about 5:30 pm.\nEnds at Lloyd 
 Center\nhttps://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-23176

SUMMARY:(We leave at 7:30pm) Mellow Mondays 2026. 5th year. Weekly themed 
 rides.No drop. Beginner friendly. Slow social pace. NakedHearts: PDX (see 
 insta).
CONTACT:NakedHearts:PDX
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to Mellow Mondays 2026.\n\nAre you interested in 
 leading a ride? This is a supportive and organized way to lead for the 
 first time. \n\nEvery week there’s different themes but there are 
 constants….\nSlow pace\, about 8 mph\,\nDistance varies but approx 10 
 miles\,\nFamily friendly\,\nWe practice consent and non-violence on all 
 our rides\, \nStore stop for safe clean bathroom access but generally we 
 try and make these stops short\, \nSkater friendly (but please check with 
 ride leader about crunchy or potential issues for skates)\,\nALL Wheels 
 friendly (scooter\, skates\, skateboard\, e bikes etc)\, \nRide is always 
 a loop\,\nCorking and traffic intersections are calm.\nBe mindful of 
 smoking around others and do not smoke around children. \n\nFAQ\,\nCan I 
 bring a speaker? Yes but please speak to the ride leader and play the 
 music they’ve carefully selected or what their preference is. \n\nCan I 
 lead a ride? Yes\, please attend a few first and get a feel for how the 
 rides are. \n\nI’ve heard NakedHearts supports other rides? Yes\, we can 
 help with planning\, encouragement\, promotion\, sound support and what 
 not. \n\nWhat do you mean you practice consent? We ask everyone (even 
 friends\, relatives\, husbands and wives with each other) to ask for 
 permission before touching anyone else or their belongings and when asking
  to seek listen and empower ‘No’.\n\nWhat do you mean you practice Non-
 violence? We specifically expect everyone to be calm\, kind and respectful
  with all car interactions. One riders aggression to a car driver can put 
 everyone else at risk. We live in a small city and are bound to encounter 
 the same drivers again. \n\nAre all your rides a protest? Yes\, being 
 together with respect and acceptance and finding comfort and joy around 
 others and strangers is an act of protest against the divisive paradigm we
  are in.\nActually we leave at 7:30 now…it’s too cold to hang 
 around\nhttps://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-23021

 rides.No drop. Beginner friendly. Slow social pace. NakedHearts: PDX (see 
 insta).
CONTACT:NakedHearts:PDX
DESCRIPTION:Cover Songs ride\, David Leads\nWelcome to Mellow Mondays 
 2026.\n\nAre you interested in leading a ride? This is a supportive and 
 organized way to lead for the first time. \n\nEvery week there’s different
  themes but there are constants….\nSlow pace\, about 8 mph\,\nDistance 
 varies but approx 10 miles\,\nFamily friendly\,\nWe practice consent and 
 non-violence on all our rides\, \nStore stop for safe clean bathroom 
 access but generally we try and make these stops short\, \nSkater friendly
  (but please check with ride leader about crunchy or potential issues for 
 skates)\,\nALL Wheels friendly (scooter\, skates\, skateboard\, e bikes 
 etc)\, \nRide is always a loop\,\nCorking and traffic intersections are 
 calm.\nBe mindful of smoking around others and do not smoke around 
 children. \n\nFAQ\,\nCan I bring a speaker? Yes but please speak to the 
 ride leader and play the music they’ve carefully selected or what their 
 preference is. \n\nCan I lead a ride? Yes\, please attend a few first and 
 get a feel for how the rides are. \n\nI’ve heard NakedHearts supports 
 other rides? Yes\, we can help with planning\, encouragement\, promotion\,
  sound support and what not. \n\nWhat do you mean you practice consent? We
  ask everyone (even friends\, relatives\, husbands and wives with each 
 other) to ask for permission before touching anyone else or their 
 belongings and when asking to seek listen and empower ‘No’.\n\nWhat do you
  mean you practice Non-violence? We specifically expect everyone to be 
 calm\, kind and respectful with all car interactions. One riders 
 aggression to a car driver can put everyone else at risk. We live in a 
 small city and are bound to encounter the same drivers again. \n\nAre all 
 your rides a protest? Yes\, being together with respect and acceptance and
  finding comfort and joy around others and strangers is an act of protest 
 against the divisive paradigm we are in.\nActually we leave at 7:30 
 now…it’s too cold to hang around\nhttps://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-

 friendly (scooter\, skates\, skateboard\, e bikes etc)\, \nRide is always 
 a loop\,\nCorking and traffic intersections are calm.\nBe mindful of 
 smoking around others and do not smoke around children. \n\nFAQ\,\nCan I 
 bring a speaker? Yes but please speak to the ride leader and play the

SUMMARY:(We leave at 7:30pm) Mellow Mondays 2026. 5th year. Weekly themed 
 rides.No drop. Beginner friendly. Slow social pace. NakedHearts: PDX (see 
 insta).
CONTACT:NakedHearts:PDX
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to Mellow Mondays 2026.\n\nAre you interested in 
 leading a ride? This is a supportive and organized way to lead for the 
 first time. \n\nEvery week there’s different themes but there are 
 constants….\nSlow pace\, about 8 mph\,\nDistance varies but approx 10 
 miles\,\nFamily friendly\,\nWe practice consent and non-violence on all 
 our rides\, \nStore stop for safe clean bathroom access but generally we 
 try and make these stops short\, \nSkater friendly (but please check with 
 ride leader about crunchy or potential issues for skates)\,\nALL Wheels 
 friendly (scooter\, skates\, skateboard\, e bikes etc)\, \nRide is always 
 a loop\,\nCorking and traffic intersections are calm.\nBe mindful of 
 smoking around others and do not smoke around children. \n\nFAQ\,\nCan I 
 bring a speaker? Yes but please speak to the ride leader and play the 
 music they’ve carefully selected or what their preference is. \n\nCan I 
 lead a ride? Yes\, please attend a few first and get a feel for how the 
 rides are. \n\nI’ve heard NakedHearts supports other rides? Yes\, we can 
 help with planning\, encouragement\, promotion\, sound support and what 
 not. \n\nWhat do you mean you practice consent? We ask everyone (even 
 friends\, relatives\, husbands and wives with each other) to ask for 
 permission before touching anyone else or their belongings and when asking
  to seek listen and empower ‘No’.\n\nWhat do you mean you practice Non-
 violence? We specifically expect everyone to be calm\, kind and respectful
  with all car interactions. One riders aggression to a car driver can put 
 everyone else at risk. We live in a small city and are bound to encounter 
 the same drivers again. \n\nAre all your rides a protest? Yes\, being 
 together with respect and acceptance and finding comfort and joy around 
 others and strangers is an act of protest against the divisive paradigm we
  are in.\nActually we leave at 7:30 now…it’s too cold to hang 
 around\nhttps://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-23028

CONTACT:NakedHearts:PDX
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to Mellow Mondays 2026.\n\nAre you interested in 
 leading a ride? This is a supportive and organized way to lead for the 
 first time. \n\nEvery week there’s different themes but there are 
 constants….\nSlow pace\, about 8 mph\,\nDistance varies but approx 10 
 miles\,\nFamily friendly\,\nWe practice consent and non-violence on all 
 our rides\, \nStore stop for safe clean bathroom access but generally we 
 try and make these stops short\, \nSkater friendly (but please check with 
 ride leader about crunchy or potential issues for skates)\,\nALL Wheels 
 friendly (scooter\, skates\, skateboard\, e bikes etc)\, \nRide is always 
 a loop\,\nCorking and traffic intersections are calm.\nBe mindful of 
 smoking around others and do not smoke around children. \n\nFAQ\,\nCan I 
 bring a speaker? Yes but please speak to the ride leader and play the 
 music they’ve carefully selected or what their preference is. \n\nCan I 
 lead a ride? Yes\, please attend a few first and get a feel for how the 
 rides are. \n\nI’ve heard NakedHearts supports other rides? Yes\, we can 
 help with planning\, encouragement\, promotion\, sound support and what 
 not. \n\nWhat do you mean you practice consent? We ask everyone (even 
 friends\, relatives\, husbands and wives with each other) to ask for 
 permission before touching anyone else or their belongings and when asking
  to seek listen and empower ‘No’.\n\nWhat do you mean you practice Non-
 violence? We specifically expect everyone to be calm\, kind and respectful
  with all car interactions. One riders aggression to a car driver can put 
 everyone else at risk. We live in a small city and are bound to encounter 
 the same drivers again. \n\nAre all your rides a protest? Yes\, being 
 together with respect and acceptance and finding comfort and joy around 
 others and strangers is an act of protest against the divisive paradigm we
  are in.\nActually we leave at 7:30 now…it’s too cold to hang

 alternative to fossil fueled travel within Portland. \n \nThis is a no-
 drop ride\, but please bring your repair kit with a spare tube so we can 
 keep the ride rolling. Please bring your own provisions\; we’ll be 
 stopping near stores\, but not at them. Each member has an eye out for the

 is casual at around 10 miles with a few park stops. \n \nWe aim to impress
  that this is a safe environment for all\; no aggressive\, sexist\, 
 racist\, or any other kind of BS will be tolerated. Please review our

CONTACT:NakedHearts:PDX
DESCRIPTION:Welcome to Mellow Mondays 2026.\n\nAre you interested in 
 leading a ride? This is a supportive and organized way to lead for the 
 first time. \n\nEvery week there’s different themes but there are 
 constants….\nSlow pace\, about 8 mph\,\nDistance varies but approx 10 
 miles\,\nFamily friendly\,\nWe practice consent and non-violence on all 
 our rides\, \nStore stop for safe clean bathroom access but generally we 
 try and make these stops short\, \nSkater friendly (but please check with 
 ride leader about crunchy or potential issues for skates)\,\nALL Wheels 
 friendly (scooter\, skates\, skateboard\, e bikes etc)\, \nRide is always 
 a loop\,\nCorking and traffic intersections are calm.\nBe mindful of 
 smoking around others and do not smoke around children. \n\nFAQ\,\nCan I 
 bring a speaker? Yes but please speak to the ride leader and play the 
 music they’ve carefully selected or what their preference is. \n\nCan I 
 lead a ride? Yes\, please attend a few first and get a feel for how the 
 rides are. \n\nI’ve heard NakedHearts supports other rides? Yes\, we can

 everyone else at risk. We live in a small city and are bound to encounter 
 the same drivers again. \n\nAre all your rides a protest? Yes\, being

 others and strangers is an act of protest against the divisive paradigm we

DESCRIPTION:Welcome to Mellow Mondays 2026.\n\nAre you interested in 
 leading a ride? This is a supportive and organized way to lead for the 
 first time. \n\nEvery week there’s different themes but there are 
 constants….\nSlow pace\, about 8 mph\,\nDistance varies but approx 10 
 miles\,\nFamily friendly\,\nWe practice consent and non-violence on all 
 our rides\, \nStore stop for safe clean bathroom access but generally we 
 try and make these stops short\, \nSkater friendly (but please check with 
 ride leader about crunchy or potential issues for skates)\,\nALL Wheels 
 friendly (scooter\, skates\, skateboard\, e bikes etc)\, \nRide is always 
 a loop\,\nCorking and traffic intersections are calm.\nBe mindful of 
 smoking around others and do not smoke around children. \n\nFAQ\,\nCan I 
 bring a speaker? Yes but please speak to the ride leader and play the 
 music they’ve carefully selected or what their preference is. \n\nCan I 
 lead a ride? Yes\, please attend a few first and get a feel for how the 
 rides are. \n\nI’ve heard NakedHearts supports other rides? Yes\, we can 
 help with planning\, encouragement\, promotion\, sound support and what 
 not. \n\nWhat do you mean you practice consent? We ask everyone (even 
 friends\, relatives\, husbands and wives with each other) to ask for 
 permission before touching anyone else or their belongings and when asking
  to seek listen and empower ‘No’.\n\nWhat do you mean you practice Non-

  with all car interactions. One riders aggression to a car driver can put 
 everyone else at risk. We live in a small city and are bound to encounter 
 the same drivers again. \n\nAre all your rides a protest? Yes\, being 
 together with respect and acceptance and finding comfort and joy around 
 others and strangers is an act of protest against the divisive paradigm we
  are in.\nActually we leave at 7:30 now…it’s too cold to hang

DESCRIPTION:Welcome to Mellow Mondays 2026.\n\nAre you interested in 
 leading a ride? This is a supportive and organized way to lead for the 
 first time. \n\nEvery week there’s different themes but there are 
 constants….\nSlow pace\, about 8 mph\,\nDistance varies but approx 10 
 miles\,\nFamily friendly\,\nWe practice consent and non-violence on all 
 our rides\, \nStore stop for safe clean bathroom access but generally we 
 try and make these stops short\, \nSkater friendly (but please check with 
 ride leader about crunchy or potential issues for skates)\,\nALL Wheels 
 friendly (scooter\, skates\, skateboard\, e bikes etc)\, \nRide is always 
 a loop\,\nCorking and traffic intersections are calm.\nBe mindful of 
 smoking around others and do not smoke around children. \n\nFAQ\,\nCan I 
 bring a speaker? Yes but please speak to the ride leader and play the 
 music they’ve carefully selected or what their preference is. \n\nCan I 
 lead a ride? Yes\, please attend a few first and get a feel for how the 
 rides are. \n\nI’ve heard NakedHearts supports other rides? Yes\, we can 
 help with planning\, encouragement\, promotion\, sound support and what 
 not. \n\nWhat do you mean you practice consent? We ask everyone (even 
 friends\, relatives\, husbands and wives with each other) to ask for 
 permission before touching anyone else or their belongings and when asking
  to seek listen and empower ‘No’.\n\nWhat do you mean you practice Non-
 violence? We specifically expect everyone to be calm\, kind and respectful
  with all car interactions. One riders aggression to a car driver can put 
 everyone else at risk. We live in a small city and are bound to encounter 
 the same drivers again. \n\nAre all your rides a protest? Yes\, being 
 together with respect and acceptance and finding comfort and joy around 
 others and strangers is an act of protest against the divisive paradigm we
  are in.\nActually we leave at 7:30 now…it’s too cold to hang 
 around\nhttps://shift2bikes.org/calendar/event-23036

DESCRIPTION:Welcome to Mellow Mondays 2026.\n\nAre you interested in 
 leading a ride? This is a supportive and organized way to lead for the 
 first time. \n\nEvery week there’s different themes but there are 
 constants….\nSlow pace\, about 8 mph\,\nDistance varies but approx 10 
 miles\,\nFamily friendly\,\nWe practice consent and non-violence on all 
 our rides\, \nStore stop for safe clean bathroom access but generally we 
 try and make these stops short\, \nSkater friendly (but please check with 
 ride leader about crunchy or potential issues for skates)\,\nALL Wheels 
 friendly (scooter\, skates\, skateboard\, e bikes etc)\, \nRide is always 
 a loop\,\nCorking and traffic intersections are calm.\nBe mindful of 
 smoking around others and do not smoke around children. \n\nFAQ\,\nCan I 
 bring a speaker? Yes but please speak to the ride leader and play the 
 music they’ve carefully selected or what their preference is. \n\nCan I 
 lead a ride? Yes\, please attend a few first and get a feel for how the

 everyone else at risk. We live in a small city and are bound to encounter 
 the same drivers again. \n\nAre all your rides a protest? Yes\, being 
 together with respect and acceptance and finding comfort and joy around 
 others and strangers is an act of protest against the divisive paradigm we

DESCRIPTION:Rook |\nEstablished in 2017\, we ride once a month to enjoy 
 what this city has to offer. Each month is led by a different CORVIDAE 
 member\, and therefore will be unique. We occasionally have themes or 
 additional donations to different organizations. Additionally\, host pop-
 up rides during the summer and collect dry non perishables for food 
 donations every month.\n\n​We try to focus our rides on greenways\, group 
 etiquette\, safety measures and general comradery. In addition to bike 
 safety and accessibility\, we want to promote using bicycles as an 
 alternative to fossil fueled travel within Portland. \n \nThis is a no-
 drop ride\, but please bring your repair kit with a spare tube so we can 
 keep the ride rolling. Please bring your own provisions\; we’ll be 
 stopping near stores\, but not at them. Each member has an eye out for the
  crowd\, will cork\, sweep and be a general pillar of support. Ride pace 
 is casual at around 10 miles with a few park stops. \n \nWe aim to impress
  that this is a safe environment for all\; no aggressive\, sexist\, 
 racist\, or any other kind of BS will be tolerated. Please review our 
 Corvidae Code of Conduct.\n\nMeet 2nd Sunday of every month\nHang at 1 PM

 others and strangers is an act of protest against the divisive paradigm we

DESCRIPTION:Raven |\nEstablished in 2017\, we ride once a month to enjoy 
 what this city has to offer. Each month is led by a different CORVIDAE 
 member\, and therefore will be unique. We occasionally have themes or 
 additional donations to different organizations. Additionally\, host pop-
 up rides during the summer and collect dry non perishables for food 
 donations every month.\n\n​We try to focus our rides on greenways\, group 
 etiquette\, safety measures and general comradery. In addition to bike 
 safety and accessibility\, we want to promote using bicycles as an 
 alternative to fossil fueled travel within Portland. \n \nThis is a no-
 drop ride\, but please bring your repair kit with a spare tube so we can 
 keep the ride rolling. Please bring your own provisions\; we’ll be 
 stopping near stores\, but not at them. Each member has an eye out for the
  crowd\, will cork\, sweep and be a general pillar of support. Ride pace 
 is casual at around 10 miles with a few park stops. \n \nWe aim to impress
  that this is a safe environment for all\; no aggressive\, sexist\, 
 racist\, or any other kind of BS will be tolerated. Please review our 
 Corvidae Code of Conduct.\n\nMeet 2nd Sunday of every month\nHang at 1 PM
